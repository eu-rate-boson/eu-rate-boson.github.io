    <h3 class="title">What Is <a href="https://www.eu-rate.eu/">Eu Rate</a>?</h3>
    <p>In a world where digital tools are increasingly part of our daily lives, educating children and young people in their use and understanding is the responsibility of educational actors.</p>
    <p>Machines, algorithms, artificial intelligence are all terms that are now part of everyone’s vocabulary, even though we do not always know what they mean.</p>
    <p>The issues of conscious use, access for all, understanding, ethics, personal data protection, but also technical training for the professions of tomorrow are today more than ever at the heart of the debates of European societies, and the questions arise from early childhood onwards. Digital education, and education through digital technology, offers opportunities in terms of education, creativity and innovation, in addition to meeting a societal need.</p>
    <p>We are 6 structures, from different European countries, that share reflections and common objectives in terms of educating young people and educational actors to digital tools, and in particular to machines, in order to give the keys to citizens to become active and not passive users of the tools. Different countries, but similar uses and issues.</p>
    <p>The project we are presenting responds to the necessity of increasing young people’s interest and success in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, making them actors in their use and promoting innovative methods, through playful robotic teaching kits accessible to all.</p>
